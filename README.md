## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of BookVerse up and running.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js 20+
*   `pnpm` (or `npm`/`yarn`)
*   A PostgreSQL database. You can use a free cloud provider like [Neon](https://neon.tech) or run it locally with Docker.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookverse.git
    cd bookverse
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Now, fill in the variables in your `.env` file:
    *   `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string.
    *   `AUTH_SECRET`: A secret key for NextAuth. Generate one with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
    *   `AUTH_URL`: Should be `http://localhost:9002` for local development.
    *   `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` & `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`: Your Google OAuth credentials (optional).
    *   `AUTH_RESEND_KEY`: API key from Resend for sending email links (if using Email provider).

4.  **Set up the database:**

    Run the Prisma migration to create the necessary tables in your database.
    ```bash
    pnpm prisma:migrate
    ```
    This will also generate the Prisma Client.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser to see the result.

### Seeding the database (optional)
You can seed the database with some sample data:
```bash
pnpm prisma:seed
```
