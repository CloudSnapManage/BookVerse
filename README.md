## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of BookVerse up and running.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js 20+
*   `pnpm` (or `npm`/`yarn`)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CloudSnapManage/BookVerse.git
    cd BookVerse
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. While no keys are strictly required for the app to run (since it's fully client-side), you can add a TMDb API key to enable movie and K-Drama search.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Now, fill in the optional variables in your `.env` file:
    *   `TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your read access token from The Movie Database (TMDb) to enable movie/drama search.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser to see the result.
